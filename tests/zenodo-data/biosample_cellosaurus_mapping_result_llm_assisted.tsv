I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking at the value of "tissue type". In this case, it's indeed "Cell line".  3. Since it's a cell line, I need to extract the cell line name from the input data.  4. After examining the data, I notice that the "sample name" field contains a string that looks like a cell line name: "CAL1-RUNX2-IP". However, this might not be the actual cell line name.  5. Upon closer inspection, I realize that the "title" field also contains a similar string: "RUNX2-IP-CAL1", which is likely to be the actual cell line name.  6. Since both fields contain similar information, I'll choose one of them as the cell line name. Let's go with the "sample name" field.  7.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type". 3. The value of "cell type" is "Bronchial Epithelial Cells". This doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. I won't find any other field that suggests a cell line name.  Since I couldn't find any information that indicates a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I also don't see any clear indication that this sample is not a cell line (e.g., "primary tissue", "patient sample"). 4. Given the lack of information pointing to a specific cell line or indicating it's not a cell line, I will err on the side of caution and assume it's not a cell line.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Look for keywords like "cell", "line", or specific cell line names in the values of the JSON object. 3. If a potential cell line name is found, verify that it matches a known cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.).  In this case, I notice that:  * The value of `"cell type"` is `"IMR90 cells"`, which suggests that IMR90 might be the cell line name. * The value of `"source_name"` also contains `"IMR90 cells"`. * IMR90 is indeed a known human diploid fibroblast cell line.  Therefore, I conclude that the cell line name in this input data is "IMR90".  Here's my output in JSON format:  `{"cell_line": "IMR90"}`	IMR90	CVCL:0347	IMR-90		CVCL:0347	CVCL:0347	IMR-90	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "GM19239". 4. Since the key "cell line" exists and has a non-empty value, I conclude that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is "GM19239".  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "GM19239"} ```	GM19239	CVCL:9634	GM19239		CVCL:9634	CVCL:9634	GM19239	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line.    - Ah, yes! There is a key called "cell line" with value "10847".  3. Since the sample is considered to be a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the input data.    - The cell line name is "10847", but it seems like it might be a part of a larger identifier (e.g., GM10847). Let me check the other fields...    - Ah, yes! In the "title" field, I see "GM10847_H3K4me3_1". It looks like the cell line name is actually "GM10847".  4. I construct the output JSON with the extracted cell line name.    - {"cell_line": "GM10847"}  So, my final answer is:  {"cell_line": "GM10847"}	GM10847	CVCL:N799	GM10847		CVCL:N799	CVCL:N799	GM10847	TRUE	correct cell line

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see that the "source_name" field has a value of "diploid fibroblast", which could potentially be related to a cell line. 4. But wait! The term "diploid fibroblast" is more likely referring to the type of cells rather than a specific cell line name. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"AGS"`. 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the `"cell line"` key. 5. The extracted cell line name is `"AGS"`. 6.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I can also look for specific values that might indicate a cell line. For example, some cell lines have distinctive names or identifiers. 4. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the value of the "source_name" key is "Primary colonic mucosa". This doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 5. Since I couldn't find any evidence suggesting this sample is a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

SAMN05214333	ChIP-Seq	{"chip antibody":"Med1", "chip antibody vendor":"Bethyl", "source_name":"SKMEL147", "title":"SKMEL147_Med1"}	To determine if the sample is a cell line and extract the cell line name, I'll go through the following steps:  1. Check if any of the fields in the JSON data contain keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines (e.g., "cell", "line", etc.).  2. Look for specific fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "source_name" or "title". 3. If I find a potential cell line name, verify if it matches any known cell line names.  In this case, the field "source_name" contains the value "SKMEL147". This looks like it could be a cell line name.  After verifying, I found that SKMEL147 is indeed a human melanoma cell line.   So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "SKMEL147"}	SKMEL147	CVCL:3876	SK-MEL-147		CVCL:3876	CVCL:3876	SK-MEL-147	TRUE	correct cell line

Here's my response:  `{"cell_line": "RMS"}`	RMS	CVCL:W879, CVCL:W527	A07-RM, RMS	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_W879.json**  * The extracted cell line name is "RMS", but this term has a different name ("A07-RM") and only one related synonym that matches ("RM"). Confidence score: 0.2 (low match) * There's no information in the input JSON about melanoma, so we can't confirm or deny the disease association. Confidence score remains at 0.2  **CVCL_W527.json**  * The extracted cell line name is "RMS", and this term has an exact match with its name ("RMS"). Confidence score: 1 (high match) * Although there's no explicit information about embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the input JSON, we do have a mention of "mutant HRAS" which could be related to cancer. This is not a strong confirmation, but it doesn't contradict either. Confidence score remains at 1  Based on these comparisons, I believe that **CVCL_W527.json** is the most likely to represent the input sample.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might contain this information. 3. The fields "background strain", "cell type", and "organism" seem promising, but they don't contain any specific cell line names. 4. Upon closer inspection, the field "source_name" contains a string "RPMI d6 rep2 H3K27me3". RPMI is a known cell line (RPMI 8226), but it's not explicitly stated here. 5. However, I'll keep looking for other potential matches. 6. After re-examining the data, I couldn't find any clear indication of a specific cell line name.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary cell or tissue sample, such as the presence of "iPS-derived" in the "cell type" field and the fact that it's been cultured for 20-30 passages. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any direct mention of a cell line name.  Given the above analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "cell type" field contains the string "colorectal cancer cell line", which indicates that this sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for a specific cell line name within the input data. After examining the fields, I find that the "title" field contains the string "DLD1 colorectal cancer cell line". 4. Based on this information, I can conclude that the cell line name is "DLD1".  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "DLD1"}  Is that correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is quite long and descriptive, but it does contain the phrase "pre B-cell line", which indicates that this might be a cell line. 3. However, I also notice that the value of the key `"source_name"` contains the phrase "Leukemia cell line (RCH-ACV)", which seems to suggest that RCH-ACV is the name of the cell line.  Given these observations, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "RCH-ACV"}`  Let me know if this looks correct!	RCH-ACV	CVCL:1851	RCH-ACV		CVCL:1851	CVCL:1851	RCH-ACV	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for some keys seem to describe primary cells or tissues rather than a cell line (e.g., "Muscle biopsy - deltoid", "Post-mitotic differentiated muscle cells (myotubes)"). 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Check if the input data contains a field that is likely to contain the cell line name. 2. Based on common practices in biological experiments, I will look for fields such as "source_name", "cell_line", "cell_type", etc. 3. In this case, I notice that the field "source_name" has a value of "HuH7 cells". This looks promising! 4. Since "HuH7 cells" is a well-known cell line, I will extract it as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "HuH7"} ``` Note: I removed the word "cells" from the original value to match the expected output format.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some specific details about the sample, such as "cell type", "organism", and "source_name". 4. Since none of these fields contain a cell line name, I'll conclude that this sample is not a cell line. 5.

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a field that indicates it is a cell line. In this case, I see a field named "cell line". 3. Since the field "cell line" exists, I extract its value: "MV4;11(Cas9; ENL-FKBP(F36V); ENL-/-)". 4. However, I notice that the value is not a simple cell line name, but rather a more complex string with additional information. 5. To provide a clean output, I will try to extract just the cell line name from this string. In this case, it seems that "MV4;11" is the cell line name (note that there might be cases where this assumption is not correct). 6. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "MV4;11"}  Please let me know if this is correct!	MV4;11	CVCL:0064	MV4-11		CVCL:0064	CVCL:0064	MV4-11	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell culture", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HEK", "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. Upon inspecting the input data, I don't see any obvious matches for common cell line names. 4. However, I notice that the "tissue type" field has a value of "meningioma". While this is not a cell line name per se, it's possible that the sample is derived from a tumor cell line. 5. Despite this possibility, without more explicit information, I'll err on the side of caution and conclude that the input data does not contain a clear indication of a cell line.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary cell sample: "cell type" mentions "colorectal adenocarcinoma", which could be a cancer cell line. 4. But, there is no clear indication of a specific cell line name.  Given the above analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it is a cell line.  * Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 2. Check the values associated with each key to see if any mention a cell line.  * The value for "cell type" is "dendritic cell", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name.  * The value for "sample type" is "in vitro differentiated cells", which also doesn't indicate a specific cell line. 3. Since I couldn't find any indication of a cell line in the input data, my output should be {"cell_line": "None"}.  So, here's my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON data: {   "accession": "SAMN06281731",   "chip antibody": "BAF155 (generated in-house epitope=aa924-1004; C-terminus)",   "organism": "Homo sapiens",   "source type": "cell line",   "source_name": "SKNMC",   "title": "BAF155 ChIP-seq in SKNMC cell line infected with shEWSFLI1" }  2. I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking at the value of "source type". In this case, it's indeed "cell line".  3. Since it's a cell line, I need to extract the cell line name from the input data. The most likely candidate for the cell line name is the value of "source_name", which is "SKNMC".  4. However, I also notice that the title contains the string "SKNMC cell line". This further confirms that "SKNMC" is indeed the cell line name.  5. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "SKNMC"}  Is this correct?	SKNMC	CVCL:0530	SK-N-MC		CVCL:0530	CVCL:0530	SK-N-MC	TRUE	correct cell line

In this case, I notice the key `"cell line"` exists in the input data. 3. Since the key `"cell line"` is present, I extract the value associated with this key, which is `"leukemia cell line MOLM13"`. 4. However, I need to provide the output in a specific format, which is `{"cell_line": "NAME"}`. So, I will only take the last part of the extracted string, assuming it's the actual cell line name, which is `"MOLM13"`.  Therefore, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "MOLM13"}`	MOLM13	CVCL:2119	MOLM-13		CVCL:2119	CVCL:2119	MOLM-13	TRUE	correct cell line

I need to check if the input data is a cell line or not. 2. Since there is no obvious indication that this sample is a cell line (e.g., no "cell_line" key, no mention of a specific cell line name), I will look for keywords that might suggest it's a primary tissue sample instead. 3. The presence of keys like "age of death", "cause of death", "gender", and "organism" suggests that this is a primary tissue sample from a human donor. 4.

This looks like a potential cell line name. 3. Since `"IMR90"` is indeed a well-known human diploid fibroblast cell line, I'll extract this as the cell line name.  My output will be:  `{"cell_line": "IMR90"}`  Let me know if this is correct!	IMR90	CVCL:0347	IMR-90		CVCL:0347	CVCL:0347	IMR-90	TRUE	correct cell line

Check if the input data contains a field that is likely to hold the cell line information. 2. Based on common naming conventions and the context of biological experiments, fields like "cell type", "cell_line", or "sample_name" are potential candidates for holding the cell line name. 3. In this specific case, I notice that the field "cell type" has a value of "Huh-7.5". This looks promising as it resembles the naming convention used for cell lines (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat). 4. Since "Huh-7.5" appears to be a cell line name, I will extract this text.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "Huh-7.5"} ```	Huh-7.5	CVCL:7927	Huh-7.5		CVCL:7927	CVCL:7927	Huh-7.5	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there's no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_type", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious mentions of cell line names. 4. However, I notice that the "title" field contains a string "14-7A.H4K16ac.Old". While this doesn't directly indicate a cell line, it's possible that the title might contain a cell line name. 5. After closer inspection, I still don't see any recognizable cell line names in the title or anywhere else in the input data.  Conclusion: Since I couldn't find any evidence of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords or phrases that might indicate a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that the "cell type" field mentions "Adipose derived stem cells", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. The "source_name" field says "primary cells", which suggests that it's not a cell line either. 5. Since I couldn't find any indication of a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "H9". 4. Since I found a cell line name in the input data, I will extract it and create a new JSON object with the extracted information.  Here's my output:  {"cell_line": "H9"}  Let me know if this is correct!	H9	CVCL:1240, CVCL:9773	H9, WA09	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_1240.json**  * The term has an exact match for the cell line name "H9" (confidence: 1.0) * However, there is no information in the input JSON that matches the disease or cell line type information of this term (confidence: 0.0)  Overall confidence score for CVCL_1240.json: 0.5  **CVCL_9773.json**  * The term has a related synonym "H9" which matches the extracted cell line name (confidence: 0.8) * There is no information in the input JSON that directly matches the disease or cell line type information of this term, but the fact that it's an embryonic stem cell line makes it more plausible given the context of the sample title "trophoblast progenitors at day 2.5" (confidence: 0.6)  Overall confidence score for CVCL_9773.json: 0.7  Based on the confidence scores, I would say that **CVCL_9773.json** is more likely to represent the input sample.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the values for "source_name" and "tissue" both contain the string "hTert-HME1 cell line". This is a strong indication that the sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Since I've found evidence of a cell line, I'll extract the name from either "source_name" or "tissue". In this case, I'll use the value from "source_name", which is "hTert-HME1 cell line". 4. However, I should remove the trailing " cell line" part to get the actual cell line name. 5. The extracted cell line name is "hTert-HME1".

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for some keys might give us a hint. For example, the value for "strain" is "primary culture". This could imply that it's not a cell line. 4. Another key-value pair that catches my attention is "organism": "Homo sapiens". While this tells us the species, it doesn't necessarily indicate a cell line. 5. After reviewing all the key-value pairs, I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name.  Therefore, based on the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Check if the input data contains any keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines (e.g., "cell line", " immortalized cells", etc.). In this case, none of those keywords are present. 2. Look for fields that could potentially contain a cell line name, such as "cell type", "source_name", or "title". 3. Inspect the values in these fields to see if they match any known cell line names.  In this input data:  * The value of "cell type" is "JMSU-1". This looks like it could be a cell line name. * The value of "source_name" is "bladder cancer cells", which doesn't seem specific enough to be a cell line name. * The value of "title" is "RXRA_S427F_Rep1", which also doesn't seem specific enough to be a cell line name.  Based on this analysis, I'm going to take a guess that the cell line name is indeed "JMSU-1".  So, my output would be:  {"cell_line": "JMSU-1"}  Please let me know if I'm correct!

I need to check if the sample is a cell line. According to the metadata, the value of `"source_name"` is `"Cell Line"`, which suggests that this sample is indeed a cell line. 2. Now, I need to extract the cell line name from the input data. The key `"cell line"` contains a string that mentions a cell line: `"derived from H9 (day 17)"`. However, it seems like "H9" might be the actual cell line name, but it's not explicitly stated. 3. Since I'm looking for a specific cell line name and "H9" is the closest match, I'll assume that's the cell line name.  So, my output would be:  `{"cell_line": "H9"}`  Please let me know if this is correct or if I should have extracted something else!

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Look for keywords like "cell line", "cells", or specific cell line names in the values of the JSON object.  Upon examining the input data, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"airway epithelial cell line"`, which indicates that this sample is indeed a cell line.  However, to extract the actual cell line name, I'll look for other keys that might contain this information. Ah-ha! The value of the key `"source_name"` is `"Calu3 cells"`. Given the context, it's likely that "Calu3" is the name of the cell line.  So, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "Calu3"}`  Let me know if this is correct!

SAMN08448353	ATAC-Seq	{"source_name":"ALL xenograft cells", "tissue":"ALL xenograft cells", "title":"ALL11_Dex_ATAC", "treatment":"Dex", "xenograft id":"ALL11"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some keywords like "xenograft" and "cells", which could be related to cell lines. 4. But without an explicit cell line name, I shouldn't extract any text from the input. 5. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN08457713	ATAC-Seq	{"cell line background":"BJ-5ta", "cell type":"immortalized BJ foreskin fibroblast cell line", "genotype/variation":"FOXA2 doxycycline inducible", "source_name":"BJ Fibroblasts", "title":"BJ_ATAC_FOXA2_10dExp_12dWD_Rep1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I need to check if the input data is a cell line or not. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I notice that there are some hints that this might be a cell line: "cell line background", "cell type", and "immortalized BJ foreskin fibroblast cell line" sounds like a cell line description. 3. However, to confirm, I'll look for specific keywords or phrases that indicate it's a cell line. Ah-ha! The value of the key "cell type" contains the phrase "immortalized BJ foreskin fibroblast cell line", which strongly suggests this is indeed a cell line. 4. Now, I need to extract the cell line name from the input data. Looking at the values again, I notice that the key "cell line background" has a value of "BJ-5ta". This could be the cell line name! 5. To confirm, I'll also check if there are any other potential cell line names in the input data. After reviewing the values, I didn't find any other strong candidates. 6. Therefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the cell line name is indeed "BJ-5ta".  Here's my output:  {"cell_line": "BJ-5ta"}	BJ-5ta	CVCL:6573	BJ1-hTERT		CVCL:6573	CVCL:6573	BJ1-hTERT	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. However, I do see a "source_name" field with value "LPS141". 3. Since "LPS141" doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names (like HeLa, Jurkat, etc.), I'll assume it's not a standard cell line. 4. Given that there is no clear indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here is the result:  {"cell_line": "None"}						CVCL:M823	LPS141	FALSE	missed cell line	Overlook

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line", "cell culture", etc.  3. In this case, I find two relevant fields: "cell line" and "sample type". The value of "sample type" is indeed "cell culture", which suggests that it's a cell line.  4. Now, I look for the cell line name in the data. Ah-ha! I found it in the field "cell line" with value "2356".  5. Since I was able to find a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "2356"}  Is that correct?	2356						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines, words like "immortalized", etc.). 3. After examining the input data, I don't see any obvious indication that this sample is a cell line. The fields and values seem to describe a specific biological sample, but not a cell line. 4.

Since I found a cell line name, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "BIN-67"}  Let me know if this is correct!	BIN-67	CVCL:S987	BIN-67		CVCL:S987	CVCL:S987	BIN-67	TRUE	correct cell line	
SAMN09742271	ChIP-Seq	{"chip antibody":"Santa Cruz, sc1003", "source_name":"human podocyte", "tissue":"podocyte", "title":"GR-ChIP-seq"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see that the "source_name" field mentions "human podocyte", which could be a primary cell or tissue sample rather than a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells". 3. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and create a new JSON output with the extracted cell line name.  Here is my output:  {"cell_line": "MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells"}  Let me know if this is correct!	MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells	CVCL:0417, CVCL:0623	MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436	Let's compare each term with the input JSON data.  **CVCL_0417.json**  * The name "MDA-MB-435" matches part of the extracted cell line name, but not exactly. * One of the related synonyms is "mda-mb-435", which is close to the extracted cell line name, but still not an exact match. * However, one of the diseases listed is "Amelanotic melanoma", and the input JSON data mentions "melanoma cells". * The cell line type is "Cancer_cell_line", which matches the context of the input JSON data.  Confidence score: 0.8  **CVCL_0623.json**  * The name "MDA-MB-436" does not match the extracted cell line name. * None of the related synonyms or exact synonyms match the extracted cell line name. * The disease listed is "Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type", which does not match the input JSON data. * The cell line type is "Cancer_cell_line", but this is a common type and not specific enough to increase confidence.  Confidence score: 0.2  Based on the confidence scores, **CVCL_0417.json** is more likely to represent the input sample. However, since the match is not exact, I will output:  {"cell_line_id": "CVCL:0417"}  Note that if there were multiple terms with similar confidence scores, I would output {"cell_line_id": "not unique"}.		CVCL:0417	MDA-MB-435	FALSE	missed cell line	Selection failure

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type", "lineage", or "organism". 3. In this case, the values of these fields ("Immature_NK", "NK", and "Homo sapiens") don't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 4. I won't extract any text from the input data because it doesn't appear to be a cell line.  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN09770761	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"small cell lung cancer", "source_name":"lung", "tissue":"lung", "title":"lung: NCI-H2227 ATAC-seq"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. In this case, I notice that the "cell type" field mentions "small cell lung cancer", which could be a hint, but it's not a clear indication of a cell line. 3. However, the "title" field contains the text "NCI-H2227 ATAC-seq". NCI-H2227 is a known cell line, so this seems promising! 4. Since I found a potential cell line name in the "title" field, I'll extract it and return it as the value for the "cell_line" key.  Here's my output:  {"cell_line": "NCI-H2227"}  Let me know if this is correct!	NCI-H2227	CVCL:1542	NCI-H2227		CVCL:1542	CVCL:1542	NCI-H2227	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "HEYA8". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "HEYA8".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I create the following response:  {"cell_line": "HEYA8"}  Is this correct?

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain a cell line name: `"cell line"` and `"isolate"`. 3. Upon closer inspection, I see that both fields contain the same value: `"C4-2B"`. This suggests that `"C4-2B"` is likely the cell line name. 4. Since I was able to find a cell line name in the input data, my output will be a JSON object with the key `"cell_line"` and the value `"C4-2B"`.  Here is my output:  `{"cell_line": "C4-2B"}`	C4-2B	CVCL:4784	LNCaP C4-2B		CVCL:4784	CVCL:4784	LNCaP C4-2B	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line" in the JSON data.  3. I find that the key "cell line" exists in the JSON data, which suggests that this sample might be a cell line.  4. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the value associated with the key "cell line" is "Osteosarcoma cell line", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name like HeLa or Jurkat.  5. Since I couldn't find a specific cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type" and "source_name" fields containing values related to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs). 4. Despite these hints, there is no clear indication of a specific cell line name. 5. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should output {"cell_line": "None"} since I couldn't find an explicit cell line name in the input data.  Here's my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. To do this, I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "cell strain", "cell line", or specific names of well-known cell lines. 3. In this case, I notice that there's a field called "cell strain" with the value "SMMC-7721". 4. Based on my knowledge, SMMC-7721 is indeed a human liver cancer cell line. 5. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and output it in JSON format.  Here's the output:  {"cell_line": "SMMC-7721"}  Let me know if this looks correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some specific details about the sample, such as "cell type", "organism", and "tissue". 4. Since none of these fields contain a well-known cell line name, I'll move on to the next step. 5. I'll also check if any of the other fields (e.g., "accession", "antibody", "source_name", "title") might contain a cell line name. 6. After reviewing all fields, I couldn't find any mention of a specific cell line name.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name like "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a primary sample:  * The presence of "passages" with a range value ("4-7") suggests that the cells have been cultured and passaged multiple times, which is consistent with cell line characteristics.  * The "cell type" field contains an abbreviation ("HUVECs"), which could be a cell line or a primary cell type. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any concrete evidence of a specific cell line name in the input data.

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for a key that indicates it's a cell line. In this case, I find the key "cell l line" (note: it seems like there's a typo in the key name, but I'll assume it's meant to be "cell line").  3. Since I found a key indicating it's a cell line, I extract the value associated with that key, which is "UWB1.289".  4. I create a new JSON object with the extracted cell line name: {"cell_line": "UWB1.289"}  So, my output would be:  {"cell_line": "UWB1.289"}	UWB1.289	CVCL:B079	UWB1.289		CVCL:B079	CVCL:B079	UWB1.289	TRUE	correct cell line

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. To do this, I'll look for keywords like "cell line" or specific cell line names in the input data. 3. In this case, I see that there is a field called "cell line" with a value of "U2OS with H2B-GFP and Halo tagged CTCF received from Anders Hansen in Xavier Darzacq lab in Berkeley". 4. The presence of this field suggests that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. Now, I need to extract the cell line name from this field. It looks like the cell line name is "U2OS", which is mentioned at the beginning of the value.  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "U2OS"}  Is that correct?	U2OS	CVCL:0042	U2OS		CVCL:0042	CVCL:0042	U2OS	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for keywords that are commonly used to describe cell lines, such as "HEK", "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. After scanning the input data, I don't see any of these keywords. The values in the fields seem to be describing a biological sample, but not a specific cell line. 4. Therefore, I conclude that this sample is not a cell line.  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN10431462	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"LSC", "patient diagnosis":"acute myeloid leukemia", "patient id":"SU353", "source_name":"LSC", "title":"SU353_LSC_5"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious matches to known cell line names. 4. However, I notice that the "title" field contains a string "SU353_LSC_5", which could potentially be a cell line name or identifier. 5. But wait! The "cell type" field has a value of "LSC", which is quite short and doesn't seem like a full cell line name. 6. Given that I couldn't find any strong evidence of a cell line name, my output will be {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here's the output: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN10492201	ATAC-Seq	{"age":"adult", "sex":"male", "source_name":"Adipose from NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders Donor 1104", "tissue":"adipose", "title":"H1.3"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field indicating it's a cell line, I'll look for common patterns or keywords in the values of the existing fields. 3. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "title" field has a value of "H1.3", which doesn't seem to match any well-known cell lines. 4. However, I also see that there is no other information that suggests it's a cell line.  Based on this analysis, my conclusion is that the input sample data does not contain a cell line name.  My output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a cell line:  * The "organism" field says "Homo sapiens", which could refer to human cells in general, but doesn't necessarily imply a specific cell line.  * The "source_name" field mentions "hNPCs", which stands for human Neural Progenitor Cells. While this is a specific type of cell, it's not typically considered a cell line. 4. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, I'll conclude that this sample data does not represent a cell line.  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "cell type" and "source_name" are quite specific, but they don't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN10596804	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"JK1", "source_name":"JK1", "title":"JK1A-23"}	To determine if the sample is a cell line and extract the cell line name, I'll follow these steps:  1. Check if the input data contains any keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines (e.g., "cell line", " immortalized", etc.). In this case, there aren't any obvious keywords. 2. Look for fields that could potentially contain a cell line name. The fields "cell type" and "source_name" seem promising. 3. Check the values of these fields to see if they match known cell line names.  In this case:  * "cell type": "JK1" * "source_name": "JK1"  Both fields have the same value, "JK1", which is not a well-known cell line name like HeLa or HEK293. However, it's possible that JK1 is a custom or lesser-known cell line.  Since I couldn't find any strong evidence to confirm that JK1 is a widely recognized cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct!						CVCL:2079	JK-1	FALSE	missed cell line	Overlook
SAMN10597936	ATAC-Seq	{"source_name":"Umblical Cord Blood Cells Undergoing Differentiation", "time point":"D8", "title":"D8_1A-65"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I can try to look for keywords or phrases that might indicate a cell line. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the "source_name" field contains the phrase "Umblical Cord Blood Cells Undergoing Differentiation". This doesn't seem like a typical cell line name. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN10611160	ChIP-Seq	{"chip antibody":"anti-SRF (Santa Cruz sc-335)", "growth medium":"Grown in serum", "source_name":"Cultured coronary artery smooth muscle cells", "tissue":"Cultured HCASMC", "title":"HCASMC SRF ChIPseq [TQ40]"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, etc.). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary tissue sample:  * The "tissue" field contains "Cultured HCASMC", which suggests that the cells have been cultured in a lab.  * The "source_name" field mentions "Cultured coronary artery smooth muscle cells". 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any specific cell line name mentioned in the data.  Given this analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with another example!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, etc.). 3. However, I do see some descriptive terms like "human HSPC-derived early erythroid progenitors" and "erythroid progenitors (E-Prog)", which could potentially be related to a cell line. 4. But, these terms don't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 5. Since I couldn't find an explicit cell line name or a clear indication that this sample is from a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this looks correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type", "organism", or "genotype". 3. In this case, the "cell type" field contains "endometrial epithelial cells", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. The "genotype" field contains "ARID1A KO", which suggests that it's a genetically modified cell line, but it's not a specific cell line name either. 5. Since I couldn't find any explicit or implicit information about a specific cell line name, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "cell type" and "source_name" are quite specific ("endometrial epithelial cells"). This could potentially be a cell line, but it's not explicitly stated. 4. Since there is no clear indication of a cell line, I will not extract any text from the input.  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line.    Yes, it does! The key "cell line" is present in the JSON object.  3. Since the key "cell line" is present, I extract its value: "WIBR3".  4. I create a new JSON output with the extracted cell line name:    {"cell_line": "WIBR3"}  So, my final output is:  {"cell_line": "WIBR3"}	WIBR3	CVCL:9767	WIBR3		CVCL:9767	CVCL:9767	WIBR3	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain the cell line name: "cell line" and "source_name". 4. The field "cell line" explicitly mentions "MEL270", which is likely to be the cell line name. 5. Since I found a potential cell line name in the input data, my output will be a JSON object with the extracted cell line name.

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line", "cell type", etc.  3. I find that the input data contains the key "cell line" with value "TTC1240".  4. Since the sample is indeed a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is "TTC1240".  5. I format my output as JSON: {"cell_line": "TTC1240"}  So, my final output is:  {"cell_line": "TTC1240"}	TTC1240	CVCL:8002	TTC-1240		CVCL:8002	CVCL:8002	TTC-1240	TRUE	correct cell line

In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "TTC1240". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "TTC1240".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I will return:  {"cell_line": "TTC1240"}  Is that correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary cell or tissue sample, such as the presence of "iPSC-derived" in the "cell type" field, which suggests that these cells have been cultured and manipulated in vitro. 4. Despite this hint, there is no clear indication that this is a well-established cell line with a specific name.  Given these observations, my conclusion is that I couldn't find any explicit mention of a cell line name in the input data.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

However, I do see some keywords like "SGBS" and "preadipocyte" which could be related to a cell line. 3. Since I couldn't find an obvious cell line name, I'll check if any of the values in the JSON object contain known cell line names. In this case, I notice that "SGBS" is part of the "cell type" and "title" fields. 4. After verifying, I found that SGBS is indeed a cell line (Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome preadipocyte cell line). Therefore, I will extract "SGBS" as the cell line name.  Here's my output:  {"cell_line": "SGBS"}	SGBS	CVCL:GS28	SGBS		CVCL:GS28		None	FALSE	missed non-cell line	Wrong extraction

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name in the standard fields (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate this sample is not a traditional cell line:  * The "source_name" field mentions "iPS derived pancreatic precursor cells", which suggests it's an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) sample. 4. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, I will output {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here is my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the value for the key "cell type" is "Primary Human Skeletal Muscle cells (hSMCs)". While this suggests that the sample is from human skeletal muscle cells, it doesn't explicitly indicate a cell line. 4.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "cell type" field mentions "SV40 large T antigen immortalized human granulosa cells", which sounds like a specific type of cell culture. 3. However, this alone doesn't confirm it's a cell line. But then I see the "source_name" field, which contains "SVOG3e cells transduced with V5-FOXL2 C134W". The presence of "cells" in this field and the specific naming convention suggests that SVOG3e might be a cell line. 4.

However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a primary sample from an organism, such as the "cell type" field containing "prostate cancer-derived fibroblasts", which could be a cell line or a primary cell culture. 4. Despite this hint, there is no clear indication of a specific cell line name.  Given these observations, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if I'm correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN11082977	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"Th17", "day":"Day 0", "donor":"1", "source_name":"Th17", "title":"ATAC_D1_S1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I need to check if the input data is a cell line or not. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication that this is a cell line (e.g., no "cell_line" key). 3. However, some cell lines have specific names that might be hidden in other fields. Let me check if any of the values match known cell line names. 4. After scanning the values, I didn't find any matches with common cell line names like HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.  Since I couldn't find any indication that this sample is a cell line or extract a specific cell line name, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN11122076	ATAC-Seq	{"cell line":"Cal27", "source_name":"Tongue", "tagmentation enzyme":"TDE1 Tagment DNA Enzyme, Illumina, #FC-121-1038", "title":"Cal27 ATAC-seq", "tumor type":"HNSCC"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"Cal27"`. 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the `"cell line"` key. 5. The extracted cell line name is `"Cal27"`. 6. I format my output as JSON, with the extracted cell line name as the value for the key `"cell_line"`.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "Cal27"}`	Cal27	CVCL:1107	CAL-27		CVCL:1107	CVCL:1107	CAL-27	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data is in JSON format... Yes, it is! 2. Next, I'll look for keywords that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell line", "cell culture", or specific names of well-known cell lines... 3. Ah-ha! In the "source_name" field, I see the phrase "SHEP MYCN neuroblastoma cell line". This suggests that the sample is indeed a cell line. 4. Now, I'll try to extract the cell line name from this field... It looks like the cell line name is "SHEP MYCN". 5. Since I was able to find a cell line name, my output will be in JSON format with the extracted name.  Here's my response:  {"cell_line": "SHEP MYCN"}	SHEP MYCN	CVCL:0524	SH-EP		CVCL:0524	CVCL:0524	SH-EP	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there's no obvious indication of a cell line, I'll look for keywords like "cell line", "cell culture", or specific cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any mention of a cell line. 4. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Here is the JSON formatted output:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell line", "clone", or specific cell line names like "HeLa" or "HEK293". 3. In this case, the input data doesn't contain any obvious cell line names or keywords. 4. However, I notice that the "cell type" field contains a value that starts with "iPS-derived". While this suggests that the cells are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), it's not a specific cell line name. 5. Given that no explicit cell line name can be found in the input data, I'll output {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here is my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary tissue sample, such as the presence of "genotype" and "source_name" fields, which could indicate a cultured or engineered sample. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any direct evidence of a cell line name in the input data.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN11357740	ATAC-Seq	{"donor id":"human donor Donor2-D13", "genotype":"BAP1-/-", "source_name":"BAP1-/- human organoids with 24 hr rescue of full length BAP1 expression", "tissue":"liver ductal organoids", "title":"hLiverOrganoids-ATACseq-V1-p53BAP1KO-FLrescue-D13-PB2newBAP1-8"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a traditional cell line:  * The "organism" field says "Homo sapiens", which suggests it's human-derived.  * The "tissue" field mentions "liver ductal organoids", which implies it's an organoid culture rather than a traditional cell line. 4. Given the lack of explicit cell line information and the presence of hints suggesting otherwise, I'll conclude that this sample is not a cell line.  According to the instructions, when no cell line name can be found, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here's my response:   {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. I notice that the values for "isolate" and "tissue" both contain the string "iPS cell line". This is a strong indication that the sample is indeed a cell line. 3. However, I don't see a specific cell line name mentioned in the input data. Cell lines are often identified by a unique name, such as HeLa or Jurkat. 4. Since I couldn't find a specific cell line name, my output will be {"cell_line": "None"}.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value for "cell type" is quite long and specific: "WI-38hTERT/GFP-RAF1-ER". This looks like a cell line name to me! 3. Since I found what appears to be a cell line name, I will extract it and format my output as JSON.  Here's the result:  {"cell_line": "WI-38hTERT/GFP-RAF1-ER"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords or phrases that might indicate a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that the "cell type" field mentions "induced endoderm cells", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. The "source_name" field mentions "ES derived endoderm cells", but again, it doesn't appear to be a specific cell line name. 5. After reviewing the input data, I couldn't find any mention of a specific cell line name.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with the value "KYSE150". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "KYSE150".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I create the following response:  {"cell_line": "KYSE150"}  Is this correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "cell type" field contains a string that seems to describe a specific cell type, but it doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names like HeLa or HEK293. 3. Since I couldn't find an obvious cell line name in the input data, my next step is to check if there are any other fields that might contain this information. 4. After reviewing all the fields, I still couldn't find a clear indication of a cell line name.  Based on these steps, my conclusion is that the input sample data does not appear to be from a well-known cell line, and therefore, I will output:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value for the key "cell type" is quite specific and mentions "RCH-ACV stably expressing estrogen inducible C/EBPa". This doesn't seem to match the typical naming convention of cell lines like HeLa or HEK293. 3. However, I also notice that the value for the key "source_name" is "BLaER", which could potentially be a cell line name. 4. Since I'm not entirely sure if "BLaER" is indeed a cell line name, I'll err on the side of caution and assume it's not a well-known cell line like HeLa or HEK293.  Given these considerations, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct!						CVCL:VQ57	BLaER1	FALSE	missed cell line	Overlook

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. In this case, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"multiple myeloma cell line"`, which indicates that it's indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for a specific cell line name in the data. I see that the value of the key `"parental cell line"` is `"KMS11"`. This could be the cell line name I'm looking for.  So, based on this analysis, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "KMS11"}`  Is that correct?	KMS11	CVCL:2989	KMS-11		CVCL:2989	CVCL:2989	KMS-11	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "MCF10A". 4. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and create a new JSON output.  Output: {"cell_line": "MCF10A"}	MCF10A	CVCL:0598	MCF-10A		CVCL:0598	CVCL:0598	MCF-10A	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might contain this information. 3. The fields "organism", "source_name", and "disease" don't seem to indicate a cell line. 4. The field "title" contains some cryptic text, but it doesn't seem to match any known cell line names. 5. The field "cell markers" is interesting, as it mentions specific cell surface proteins (CD4+, CD26-), which could be related to a cell line. However, these markers alone don't uniquely identify a cell line.  After careful examination, I couldn't find any clear indication that this sample is a cell line or contains information about a specific cell line name.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I notice "cell type" has a value of "Human iPS cells". While this is a specific type of cell, it doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 3. I'll also check other keys like "source_name", but it seems to describe the source of the sample rather than a specific cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line/strain"`. This could be a good candidate for containing the cell line name. 3. The value associated with this key is `"H1"`. 4. Since I found a potential cell line name, I will extract it and return it in the required JSON format.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "H1"} ```	H1	CVCL:HA53, CVCL:9771	H20961, WA01	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_HA53.json**  * The extracted cell line name "H1" is present in the related synonyms list, so that's a good match (score: 0.8). * However, there is no exact match for the cell type or any other information in the input JSON. * Confidence score: 0.4  **CVCL_9771.json**  * The extracted cell line name "H1" is present in the related synonyms list, so that's a good match (score: 08). * Additionally, the cell type "hESCs derived Endothelial cells" in the input JSON matches with the cell line type "Embryonic_stem_cell" in this term, which is a close match (score: 0.6). * Confidence score: 0.7  Comparing the confidence scores, **CVCL_9771.json** has a higher score (0.7) than **CVCL_HA53.json** (0.4). Therefore, I output:  ```json {"cell_line_id": "CVCL:9771"} ```  Note that while there is some uncertainty in the match, CVCL_9771.json appears to be the most likely representation of the input sample based on the available information.

Check if the sample is a cell line:     The value of "cell type" is "Cell Line", so yes, this sample is a cell line.  2. Extract the cell line name:    Since it's a cell line, I'll look for a field that might contain the cell line name.    In this case, I notice that the "title" field contains a string that looks like it could be a cell line name: "2173-STC1_E".  However, I'm not entirely confident that this is indeed the cell line name. Cell line names are often specific and well-known (like HeLa or HEK293), so I'll look for other fields that might contain more information.  Upon closer inspection, I notice that the "source_name" field contains a string that could potentially be related to the cell line: "Melanoma Short Term Cultures".  But still, this doesn't seem like a specific cell line name.   After re-examining the data, I realize that there isn't an obvious field containing a well-known cell line name.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if I'm correct or not!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"ER+ Breast Cancer Cell Line"`, which indicates that this sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for a specific cell line name within the input data. After examining the values, I find that the string `"MCF7"` appears in multiple places, including the `"genotype/variation"` and `"source_name"` fields. This suggests that `"MCF7"` is likely the cell line name. 4. Since I was able to identify a cell line name, my output will be a JSON object with the key `"cell_line"` and the value set to the extracted cell line name.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "MCF7"}`	MCF7	CVCL:0031	MCF-7		CVCL:0031	CVCL:0031	MCF-7	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I see that there is a key called "cell line".  3. Since the key "cell line" exists, I extract the value associated with it: "HNSCC cell line SCC25".  4. However, I notice that the value contains more information than just the cell line name. To provide a clean output, I will try to extract only the cell line name.  5. After re-examining the value, I decide to extract "SCC25" as the cell line name, assuming it's the most specific and relevant part of the string.  6. Finally, I format my output in JSON: {"cell_line": "SCC25"}  So, my response would be:  {"cell_line": "SCC25"}	SCC25	CVCL:1682, CVCL:7735	SCC-25, UM-SCC-25	Let's compare each term with the input JSON and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_1682**  * The term has an exact synonym match with the extracted cell line name, "SCC25" (confidence: 1.0). * However, there is no direct information in the input JSON that confirms the disease or cell line type matches (confidence: 0.5).

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line/strain"`. This could potentially contain the cell line name. 3. The value associated with this key is `"human embryonic stem cell H1"`. 4. Since this value contains the words "stem cell", which is often used to describe cell lines, and also has a specific identifier "H1", I'm going to assume that this is indeed a cell line. 5. Therefore, I will extract the string `"H1"` as the cell line name.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "H1"}`  Let me know if this looks correct!

Since I found a potential cell line name, I'll extract it and create the output JSON.  Here's my response:  {"cell_line": "K562"}  Let me know if this is correct!	K562	CVCL:0004	K-562		CVCL:0004	CVCL:0004	K562	TRUE	correct cell line	
SAMN13109377	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"LDG", "diagnosis":"Lupus", "source_name":"Human whole blood", "title":"LDG_SLE_01_mat [ATAC-seq]"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might contain this information. 3. The fields "cell type", "organism", and "source_name" seem to provide some context, but they don't explicitly mention a cell line name. 4. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, I will conclude that the input sample data is not considered to be a cell line.  According to the instructions, when no cell line name can be found, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here it is!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type". 3. The value of "cell type" is "human aortic endothelial cell". This doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. I won't find any other field that suggests a cell line name.  Since I couldn't find any information that indicates a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a cell line:  * The "cell type" field mentions "human aortic endothelial cell", which sounds like a primary cell type rather than a cell line.  * There is no mention of a specific cell line name in the "title", "source_name", or any other fields. 4. Given that I couldn't find any strong evidence suggesting it's a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this looks correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there are two fields related to cell lines: `"cell line"` and `"source_name"`. Both contain the string "Ramos". 4. Since both fields suggest that the sample is from the Ramos cell line, I decide to extract the cell line name from the input data. 5. The extracted cell line name is "Ramos".  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "Ramos"} ```	Ramos	CVCL:0597	Ramos		CVCL:0597	CVCL:0597	Ramos	TRUE	correct cell line

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. To do this, I'll look for keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "cells" or specific names of cell lines. 3. In the given JSON data, I notice that the value of the key "source_name" is "HEC-1-B cells". This suggests that the sample might be a cell line. 4. Upon closer inspection, I realize that "HEC-1-B" is indeed a specific name of a cell line. 5. Therefore, I will extract the cell line name from the input data.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "HEC-1-B"} ```	HEC-1-B	CVCL:0294	HEC-1-B		CVCL:0294	CVCL:0294	HEC-1-B	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"source_name"` is `"Ramos cell line"`. This seems promising! 3. Since "Ramos" sounds like a specific name, I'm going to assume that this might be the cell line name. 4. However, I also notice that there's another field called `"strain"` which contains more information about the cell line. But it doesn't seem to have a clear, concise name that matches the format of other well-known cell lines like HeLa or Jurkat. 5. Given this analysis, I'm going to extract the value from `"source_name"` as the potential cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "Ramos"} ```	Ramos	CVCL:0597	Ramos		CVCL:0597	CVCL:0597	Ramos	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the "source_name" field has a value that sounds like it could be related to a cell line: "Human bladder tumor organoid". 4. But upon closer inspection, this doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.). 5.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the title field contains the string "Cell line". 3. This indicates that the sample is indeed a cell line. 4. Next, I'll look for the cell line name within the title field. 5. The title field contains the string "STS26T Cell line H3K4me3 ChIP". It seems like "STS26T" could be the cell line name.  Based on this analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "STS26T"}  Let me know if I'm correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for some keys seem to be quite specific and descriptive, which might indicate that it's not a cell line. 4. Upon closer inspection, I see that the "cell type" is listed as "Naive T lymphocytes", which suggests that this sample is from primary cells rather than a cell line. 5. Since I couldn't find any indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON data: {   "accession": "SAMN13512667",   "cell line": "HUES 8 hESC line",   "cell type": "hPSC-derived poly-hormonal cell",   "developmental stage": "Stage 6 week 3",   "organism": "Homo sapiens",   "source_name": "HUES 8 hESC line",   "title": "week3_PH_ATAC_rep3" }  2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line.    Yes, it does! The key "cell line" is present in the JSON object.  3. Since the key "cell line" exists, I extract its value: "HUES 8 hESC line".  4. Now, I create a new JSON output with the extracted cell line name:    {"cell_line": "HUES 8 hESC line"}  And that's it! Here is my final answer:  {"cell_line": "HUES 8 hESC line"}	HUES 8 hESC line	CVCL:B207	HUES 8		CVCL:B207		None	FALSE	missed non-cell line	Deriviation

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"immortalized epithelial cell line obtained from patients with ADPKD"`. This indicates that the sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for any specific information about the cell line name within the input data. 4. The value of the key `"cell line background"` is `"WT 9-12"`, which seems like it could be the cell line name.  Based on this analysis, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "WT 9-12"}`  Let me know if I'm correct!	WT 9-12	CVCL:K230	WT 9-12		CVCL:K230	CVCL:K230	WT 9-12	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "MM001". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "MM001".  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "MM001"}  Let me know if this is correct!	MM001						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Look for keywords like "cell line", "cell lines", or specific names of known cell lines. 3. In this case, I notice that the "tissue" field mentions "mixture of 5 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines". This indicates that the sample is indeed a mixture of cell lines. 4. However, since it's a mixture of multiple cell lines, there isn't a single cell line name to extract. 5. But wait! The title field contains specific names of cell lines: "H2228_H1975_A549_H838_HCC827". These are likely the individual cell line names that make up the mixture.  Given this information, I would output:  {"cell_line": "None"}  The reason is that while we have identified multiple cell line names, there isn't a single cell line name to extract. If you'd like, I can modify my response to include all the individual cell line names mentioned in the title field, but it wouldn't fit the original format of {"cell_line": "NAME"}. Let me know!

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line" or "cell type". In this case, both keys are present.  3. Since it's a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the input data. The value associated with the key "cell line" is "GM11906".  4. I construct the output JSON object: {"cell_line": "GM11906"}  So, my final answer is:  {"cell_line": "GM11906"}	GM11906	CVCL:IN29	GM11906		CVCL:IN29	CVCL:IN29	GM11906	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that there is a key called "cell type" with value "adipocytes". While this suggests that the sample is related to cells, it doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN13862411	ATAC-Seq	{"age of death":"20", "alcohol toxicology":"negative", "cause of death":"sudden cardiac death", "cell type":"glutamatergic neurons", "gender":"male", "source_name":"primary visual cortex", "tissue":"primary visual cortex", "title":"S2_GLU_PVC"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "organism" or "tissue". 3. However, in this case, the values of these fields ("Homo sapiens" and "primary visual cortex") suggest that it's not a cell line. 4. Additionally, there is no mention of any specific cell line names like HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc. 5. Therefore, I conclude that the input sample data is not from a cell line.  Output: {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell_type", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. After scanning the input data, I don't see any of these keywords. The fields like "organism", "tissue", and "source_name" suggest that this sample might be from a human tissue rather than a cell line.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "IMR-5". 4. Since the key "cell line" is present and has a non-empty value, I conclude that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is "IMR-5".

In this case, I find two relevant fields: `"cell line"` and `"source_name"`. Both seem to contain information about the cell line. 4. However, since `"cell line"` is explicitly mentioned in the prompt as the field that might contain the cell line name, I will prioritize it over `"source_name"`. 5. The value of the `"cell line"` field is `"lung cancer cell line NCI-H1944"`. This seems to be a descriptive text that includes the cell line name. 6. To extract just the cell line name, I can remove the prefix `"lung cancer cell line "` from the text. 7. After removing the prefix, I am left with `"NCI-H1944"` as the potential cell line name.

However, I notice that the value for the key "organism" is "Homo sapiens", which could imply a human-derived sample. 4. But then I look at the values for "tissue" and "cell type", which are "Human small intestine" and "organoids", respectively. Organoids are often derived from primary tissues, but they can also be cultured in vitro. 5. Given that there's no clear indication of a cell line, I'll err on the side of caution and assume it's not a cell line.  Output: {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN14122096	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"OVCAR8", "genotype":"WT", "passage":"10-15", "source_name":"OVCAR8", "title":"Ovarian cancer cell line"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I need to check if the sample is a cell line. The presence of keywords like "cell line" or specific cell line names in the metadata can indicate this. 2. In the given JSON data, I notice that the value for the key "title" is "Ovarian cancer cell line". This suggests that the sample might be a cell line. 3. However, to confirm and extract the cell line name, I should look for more specific information. The values for the keys "cell type" and "source_name" both contain the string "OVCAR8". 4. Based on this, it appears that "OVCAR8" is likely the name of the cell line.  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "OVCAR8"}	OVCAR8	CVCL:1629	OVCAR-8		CVCL:1629	CVCL:1629	OVCAR-8	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type", "organism", or "title". 3. In this case, the "cell type" field has a value of "Neural stem cells", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. The "title" field contains "hNSCs", which could potentially be an abbreviation for a cell line, but it's not a well-known cell line name like HeLa or HEK293. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type", "organism", or "source_name". 3. In this case, the values of these fields ("Neural stem cells", "Homo sapiens", and "Neural stem cells") do not seem to match any well-known cell line names. 4. I'll also check if there are any other fields that might contain a cell line name, but none of them seem to match. 5. Since I couldn't find any information that suggests it's a cell line or extract a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type". 3. The value of "cell type" is "cDC2". While this looks like a specific cell type, it doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 4. I won't extract any text from the input data since it doesn't appear to be a cell line.  My output will be: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "cell type" and "source_name" are quite specific, but they don't seem to match any well-known cell line names. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN14427981	ChIP-Seq	{"antibody/treatment":"anti-human/mouse/Rat SOX2 (pAb, goat, R&D systems cat@#AF2018)", "cell line":"MKL1", "cell type":"Merkel Cell carcinoma (MCC)", "enrichment target":"SOX2", "source_name":"MKL1", "target function":"Transcription Factor", "title":"MKL1 SOX2", "virus status":"positive"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with value `"MKL1"`. 3. Since the key `"cell line"` exists and has a non-empty value, I conclude that the sample is indeed a cell line. 4. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is `"MKL1"`. 5. I format my output as JSON with the extracted cell line name: `{"cell_line": "MKL1"}`.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "MKL1"} ```	MKL1	CVCL:2600	MKL-1		CVCL:2600	CVCL:2600	MKL-1	TRUE	correct cell line

I need to check if the sample is a cell line. Looking at the data, I see that the value of "cell type" is "Gastric cancer cell line", which suggests that it might be a cell line. 2. However, I don't see any specific cell line name mentioned in the data. Cell lines usually have a specific name like HeLa or Jurkat. 3. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the value of "source_name" is also "Gastric cancer cell line", which reinforces the idea that it's a cell line, but still no specific name. 4. Since I couldn't find any specific cell line name in the data, my output should be {"cell_line": "None"}.  So, here is my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might contain this information. 3. The field "cell type" has a value of "prostate cancer", which doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. The field "title" contains the string "PC3 control HDAC1 rep1". PC3 is actually a well-known prostate cancer cell line. 5. Based on this, I'll extract the cell line name from the title.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "PC3"} ```	PC3	CVCL:0035, CVCL:4011, CVCL:4055, CVCL:S982, CVCL:C8XA	PC-3, PaCa-3, SK-PC-3, PC-3 [Human lung carcinoma], HNC PC3	Let's evaluate each term and assign a confidence score based on the matching information.  1. CVCL_0035.json:  * Name/Synonym match: Exact match with "PC3" (confidence: 0.8)  * Disease/Cell line type match: Prostate carcinoma matches the sample's cell type "prostate cancer" (confidence: 0.9)  Total confidence score: 0.85 2. CVCL_4011.json:  * Name/Synonym match: Related synonym match with "PC3", but not exact (confidence: 0.4)  * Disease/Cell line type match: Pancreatic carcinoma does not match the sample's cell type "prostate cancer" (confidence: 0.1)  Total confidence score: 0.25 3.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords or phrases that might indicate a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that the "cell type" field mentions "human naive induced pluripotent stem cells", which sounds like a specific type of cell culture, but it's not a clear indication of a cell line. 4. I also check other fields, such as "title", "accession", and "source_name", but none of them seem to contain a cell line name. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I can look for specific values or patterns that might indicate a cell line. For example, some cell lines have distinctive names or keywords. 4. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the "title" field contains the string "BulkATAC Control Hippocampus 3". While this title seems to describe an experiment or sample, it doesn't appear to be a specific cell line name. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "HSJ-019". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "HSJ-019".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I will return:  {"cell_line": "HSJ-019"}  Is that correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is a field called "parental cell line" with the value "T-47D". This could indicate that the sample is derived from a cell line. 3. However, I also see that the "organism" field has the value "Homo sapiens", which suggests that the sample might be of human origin, but it doesn't necessarily confirm that it's a cell line. 4. Considering the presence of the "parental cell line" field and its value, I'll assume that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. The value in the "parental cell line" field, "T-47D", seems to be the name of the cell line.  Based on this analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "T-47D"}  Please let me know if I'm correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the value for the key "source_name" is "primary cells". This suggests that the sample might not be a cell line, as primary cells are typically isolated directly from an organism and not cultured in a lab. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary cell culture or tissue sample, such as the "cell type" field containing a specific term ("Fibroblast like Synoviocytes"). 4. Despite these hints, there is no clear indication of a cell line name. 5. Therefore, according to the instructions, I will output {"cell_line": "None"} since I couldn't find any explicit mention of a cell line name.  Here's my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with value `"SCC-25"`. 3. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and create a new JSON object with the extracted information.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "SCC-25"}`  Let me know if this is correct!	SCC-25	CVCL:1682, CVCL:7735	SCC-25, UM-SCC-25	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_1682.json**  * The term has an exact match for the cell line name "SCC-25" (confidence: 1.0) * The term has disease information that matches the sample's cell type "oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)" is not an exact match, but it's related to squamous cell carcinoma (confidence: 0.8) * Overall confidence score: 0.9  **CVCL_7735.json**  * The term does not have an exact match for the cell line name "SCC-25", although it has a related synonym "scc25" (confidence: 0.4) * The term has disease information that does not match the sample's cell type "oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)" is not related to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (confidence: 0.2) * Overall confidence score: 0.3  Based on the confidence scores, **CVCL_1682.json** is more likely to represent the input sample.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some specific details about the sample, such as "cell type", "organism", and "source_name". 4. Since none of these fields contain a well-known cell line name, I'll conclude that this sample is not a cell line. 5. According to the instructions, when no cell line name is found, my output should be {"cell_line": "None"}.  So, here's my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of "cell type" is "ROSA Kit D816V mast cell line". The presence of the word "line" in this field indicates that it might be a cell line. 3. To confirm, I'll look for any specific keywords or phrases that are commonly used to identify cell lines. In this case, I notice that the value contains the phrase "mast cell line", which is a strong indication that it's a cell line. 4. Now, I'll try to extract the cell line name from the data. Based on the format of the "cell type" field, I'm going to assume that the cell line name is the part of the string before the words "mast cell line". Therefore, I'll extract the substring "ROSA Kit D816V" as the potential cell line name. 5. Since I was able to find a potential cell line name, my output will be in JSON format with the extracted value.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.). 3. However, I do see that the "source" field mentions "Glioblastoma", which could be related to a cell line. 4. But wait! The "source_name" field provides more context: "Glioblastoma neurosphere cell suspensions". This doesn't seem like a standard cell line name either. 5. After carefully reviewing the data, I couldn't find any clear indication of a specific cell line name.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

SAMN14677857	ChIP-Seq	{"cell line":"Im-GCT-4072", "chip antibody":"H3K36me3 (Mouse monoclonal/GeneTex MABI0333-GTX50908)", "genotype":"G34W repair to WT", "source_name":"Tumor-derived cell-line", "title":"Im-GCT-4072__D6__p8__G34W-repair__H3K36me3"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "Im-GCT-4072". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "Im-GCT-4072".  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "Im-GCT-4072"}  Let me know if this is correct!	Im-GCT-4072	CVCL:1229, CVCL:3980, CVCL:W444	GCT, Mel Im, IM	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score for each.  **CVCL_1229.json**  * The name "GCT" does not match the extracted cell line name "Im-GCT-4072". * There is no mention of "Im-GCT-4072" in the synonyms or related synonyms. * The disease information "Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma" does not match any information in the input JSON.  Confidence score: 0.1 (very low)  **CVCL_3980.json**  * One of the related synonyms is "Im", which is part of the extracted cell line name "Im-GCT-4072". * The disease information "Melanoma" does not match any information in the input JSON. * However, the input JSON mentions a tumor-derived cell-line, which could be related to melanoma.  Confidence score: 0.4 (medium)  **CVCL_W444.json**  * One of the exact synonyms is "IM", which is part of the extracted cell line name "Im-GCT-4072". * The disease information "Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma" does not match any information in the input JSON. * However, the input JSON mentions a tumor-derived cell-line, which could be related to ovarian cancer.  Confidence score: 0.5 (medium-high)  Based on these confidence scores, I would say that **CVCL_W444.json** is the most likely to represent the input sample, but with some uncertainty. Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line_id": "CVCL:W444"}  However, please note that the confidence score is not extremely high, and there might be other factors to consider when making a final decision.	CVCL:W444		None	FALSE	missed non-cell line	Selection failure

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line.    Ah, yes! There is a key called "cell line" in the JSON object.  3. Since there is a "cell line" key, I extract the value associated with it: "A375 cells expressing HA-tagged PRL3".  4. However, according to your instructions, I should only output the cell line name if it's a well-known cell line (like HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc.).     In this case, "A375" seems to be a cell line name, but I'll assume it is and proceed.  5.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate a cell line:  * The "cell_type" field mentions "adipocytes differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells", which could imply a cultured cell type.  * The "tissue" field is listed as "umbilical cord", but this doesn't necessarily mean it's a primary tissue sample; it could be a cultured cell line derived from umbilical cord tissue. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any concrete evidence that suggests the sample is a specific cell line with a well-known name (e.g., HeLa). 5. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line by looking for the key "cell line".  3. Since the key "cell line" exists, I extract the value associated with it: "Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC)".  4. However, based on your instructions, you want me to output only the name of the cell line in a specific format {"cell_line": "NAME"}.  5. Therefore, I will use the extracted value as the NAME and create the output JSON: {"cell_line": "Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC)"}  Here is my final answer:  {"cell_line": "Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC)"}	Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells (HCASMC)						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I need to check if the sample is a cell line. 2. Looking at the JSON data, I see that there is a field called `"tissue/cell line"`. This could potentially contain the cell line name. 3. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the value of this field is `"JHU-LX48-SCLC PDX"`, which doesn't seem to match any well-known cell line names like HeLa or Jurkat. 4. But wait! The field name itself contains the word "cell line", and the value does contain a string that could be a cell line name, albeit not a very common one. 5. Since I couldn't find an exact match with a well-known cell line name, but the field suggests it's a cell line, I will extract the value of this field as the cell line name.  So, my output would be:  `{"cell_line": "JHU-LX48-SCLC PDX"}`  Please let me know if this is correct!	JHU-LX48-SCLC PDX						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line", "cell_line", etc. in the JSON data.  3. I find that the key "cell line" exists in the JSON data, which suggests that this sample might be a cell line.  4. Since the key "cell line" exists, I extract the value associated with it, which is "BIN67".  5. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "BIN67"}  Is that correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a cell line:  * The "organism" field says "Homo sapiens", which suggests it's human tissue.  * The "source_name" field says "Human postnatal thymus", which further supports the idea that it's human tissue. 4. Given these observations, I conclude that this sample is not a cell line.  According to the instructions, when the input sample data is not of a cell line, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here is my response:   {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords in the values of other fields. 3. Upon inspecting the values, I notice that none of them seem to match common cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 4. The value of the "source_name" field is "CRPC PDX", which doesn't appear to be a standard cell line name. 5.

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "SUM-229PE". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "SUM-229PE".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I create the following response:  {"cell_line": "SUM-229PE"}  Is this correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the value for the key "cell type" is "differentiated hESCs". While this suggests that the sample is derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), it doesn't explicitly indicate a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I see that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "SW872 liposarcoma cells".  3. Since the input data is indeed from a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key.  4. The extracted cell line name is "SW872 liposarcoma cells". However, based on common naming conventions for cell lines, it's likely that the actual cell line name is just "SW872".  5. Nevertheless, since the input data explicitly mentions "SW872 liposarcoma cells" as the cell line, I will stick with this value.  6. Finally, I format my output in JSON format: {"cell_line": "SW872 liposarcoma cells"}  So, here is my response:  {"cell_line": "SW872 liposarcoma cells"}	SW872 liposarcoma cells	CVCL:1730	SW872		CVCL:1730	CVCL:1730	SW872	TRUE	correct cell line

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it is a cell line.  * Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 2. Since there's no explicit mention of a cell line, let's check if any of the values contain keywords that might indicate a cell line.  * Upon reviewing the values, I notice that the "cell type" field contains "Pulmonary artery endothelial cells". While this suggests a specific type of cell, it doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. 3. Given that there's no clear indication of a cell line in the input data, I will output {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here is my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I need to check if the input data contains information that indicates it is a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I notice that there is no explicit key that says "cell_line" or something similar. 3. However, I do see a key called "source_name" with value "HT29". This could potentially be a cell line name. 4. Based on my knowledge of commonly used cell lines, HT29 is indeed a well-known human colorectal cancer cell line.  Therefore, I will extract the cell line name from the input data and output it in JSON format:  {"cell_line": "HT29"}	HT29	CVCL:0320	HT-29		CVCL:0320	CVCL:0320	HT-29	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain the cell line name: "cell line" and "source_name". 4. The field "cell line" has a value of "SEM", which seems like a plausible cell line name. 5. The field "source_name" also contains the string "SEM cell line", which further supports the idea that "SEM" is indeed the cell line name. 6. Since I was able to find a likely cell line name, my output will be in JSON format with the extracted cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "SEM"} ```	SEM	CVCL:0095	SEM		CVCL:0095	CVCL:0095	SEM	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell culture", I'll look for keywords commonly associated with cell lines, such as "immortalized", "transformed", or specific cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat). 3. After reviewing the input data, I couldn't find any indication that this sample is a cell line. The fields like "organism", "tissue", and "source_name" suggest it's a biological sample from a human individual. 4.

SAMN16786364	ATAC-Seq	{"isolate":"NA12878", "sex":"female", "tissue":"B-Lymphocyte", "title":"Human sample from Homo sapiens"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, some cell lines are derived from specific tissues or organisms, so I'll check if the values for "tissue" or "organism" match any known cell lines. 4. In this case, the "tissue" is "B-Lymphocyte", which doesn't directly indicate a specific cell line. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN16817051	ATAC-Seq	{"cancer type":"Human ALL Clinical Sample", "cell type":"primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells", "source_name":"Human ALL Clinical Sample", "title":"ATACseq_3"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell line", " immortalized", or specific cell line names like "HeLa" or "Jurkat". 3. In this case, the input data doesn't contain any obvious indicators of a cell line. 4. However, I notice that the "cell type" field contains the phrase "primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells". While this suggests a specific type of cell, it's not a clear indication of a cell line. 5. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN16856004	ATAC-Seq	{"source_name":"PDX lung adenocarcinoma", "tissue":"lung adenocarcinoma", "title":"482 (PDX)"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some keywords like "PDX" which could be related to a specific type of cell line (Patient-Derived Xenograft). 4. But without an explicit cell line name, I should not extract any text from the input.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "K562 cells". 4. Since the key explicitly mentions "cell line", I can confidently extract the cell line name from this value. 5. The extracted cell line name is "K562".  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "K562"}  Let me know if this is correct!	K562	CVCL:0004	K-562		CVCL:0004	CVCL:0004	K-562	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"SCCOHT-1"`. 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the `"cell line"` key. 5. The extracted cell line name is `"SCCOHT-1"`. 6. I format my output as JSON, with the extracted cell line name as the value for the key `"cell_line"`.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "SCCOHT-1"}`	SCCOHT-1	CVCL:VU69	SCCOHT-1		CVCL:VU69	CVCL:VU69	SCCOHT-1	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. However, I see that the "cell type" field has a value of "Immortalized myoblast", which could indicate that it's a cell line. 3. But wait! The presence of "Immortalized myoblast" alone doesn't necessarily mean it's a well-known cell line with a specific name. 4. I'll also check the "source_name" field, which has a value of "Dbt/iP3F". This could potentially be a cell line name, but without more context or information, I'm not confident that it is.  Given these observations, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  I couldn't find any conclusive evidence to extract a specific cell line name from the input data.							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "786-M1A". 4. Since this key-value pair indicates that the sample is indeed a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the "cell line" key.  Output: {"cell_line": "786-M1A"}	786-M1A	CVCL:VR30	786-M1A		CVCL:VR30	CVCL:VR30	786-M1A	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit mention of a cell line name, I'll look for keywords or phrases that might indicate a cell line (e.g., "cell line", " immortalized", etc.). However, in this case, none of these keywords are present. 3. The value of the "source_name" field is "Primary FLS". While "FLS" could potentially stand for a cell line name, it's not a commonly used cell line name like HeLa or HEK293. Moreover, the prefix "Primary" suggests that this might be a primary cell culture rather than an immortalized cell line. 4. Given the lack of clear evidence pointing to a specific cell line, I will output {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here is my response:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell culture", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as " immortalized", "transformed", or specific names of well-known cell lines. 3. After reviewing the input data, I don't see any indication that this sample is a cell line. The fields like "organism", "tissue", and "source_name" suggest it's a biological sample from a human, but not a cultured cell line.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if I'm correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN17131558	ATAC-Seq	{"diagnosis":"Recurrent glioblastoma", "source_name":"patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma", "tissue":"glioblastoma", "title":"pCGY2937_recurrent"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a cell line:  * The "source_name" field mentions "patient-derived", which implies that the sample comes from a patient rather than a cultured cell line.  * The "tissue" field specifies "glioblastoma", which is a type of tumor, further supporting the idea that this is not a cell line. 4. Given these observations, I conclude that this sample is not a cell line.  According to the instructions, when no cell line name can be found, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here it is!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"lung avleolar type 2 cells"`. 3. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and create a new JSON object with the extracted information. 4. The output will be: `{"cell_line": "lung avleolar type 2 cells"}`  Here is the final output:  `{"cell_line": "lung avleolar type 2 cells"}`	lung avleolar type 2 cells						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see that the "cell type" field has a value of "MSC", which could potentially be a cell line. But MSC can also stand for Mesenchymal Stem Cells, which is not necessarily a specific cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any conclusive evidence of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell_type", I'll look for keywords commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. After scanning the input data, I don't see any mention of known cell line names. 4. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Here is the JSON formatted output:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a traditional cell line:  * The "cell type" field mentions "hiPSC-derived erythroid cells", which suggests that these are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that have been differentiated into erythroid cells.  * The "source_name" field also supports this interpretation, mentioning "hiPSC-derived erythroid cells". 4. Given the lack of explicit cell line information and the presence of iPSC-related terms, I conclude that this sample is not a traditional cell line.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" which suggests that it might be related to a cell line.  3. Since the key "cell line" exists and has a value, I assume that the sample is indeed a cell line.  4. The value associated with the "cell line" key is "SKNAS". This appears to be the name of the cell line.  5. Therefore, I extract the cell line name "SKNAS" from the input data.  6.

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain the cell line name: "cell line" and "source_name". 4. The field "cell line" has a value of "Miapaca2", which seems like a plausible cell line name. 5. Since I found a potential cell line name in the "cell line" field, I will extract it as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "Miapaca2"} ```	Miapaca2	CVCL:0428	MIA PaCa-2		CVCL:0428	CVCL:0428	MIA PaCa-2	TRUE	correct cell line

Check if the input data contains any information that suggests it is a cell line. 2. Look for keywords such as "cell line", " immortalized", or specific names of well-known cell lines (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. In this case, I don't see any obvious indication that the sample is a cell line.  However, I notice that the "title" field contains the text "SJTALL005006 cells". This could potentially be a cell line name, but it's not immediately clear.  4. Since I'm not confident that "SJTALL005006" is indeed a cell line name, and there are no other obvious indications of a cell line, I will err on the side of caution. 5. Therefore, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct or if I should have extracted something else!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN17493275	ChIP-Seq	{"condition":"dilated cardiomyopathy", "factor":"H3K27ac", "method":"ChIP-Seq", "source_name":"heart tissue", "tissue":"heart", "title":"DCM-8_ChIP"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I can also look for specific values that might indicate a cell line. For example, some cell lines have distinctive names or identifiers. 4. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the "source_name" field contains the value "heart tissue". This suggests that the sample is derived from heart tissue, but it doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN17493294	ATAC-Seq	{"condition":"dilated cardiomyopathy", "method":"ATAC-Seq", "source_name":"heart tissue", "tissue":"heart", "title":"DCM-9_ATAC"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell_type", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. After scanning the input data, I don't see any of these keywords. The fields like "source_name", "tissue", and "organism" suggest that this sample is from a human heart tissue, but not a cell line.  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN17610226	ATAC-Seq	{"cause of death":"cerebral vascular accident", "donor sex":"female", "race":"asian", "sample preparation":"flash-frozen tissue", "sample type":"normal", "source_name":"stomach", "title":"stomach_SM-JF1O3"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell culture", I'll look for other hints, such as specific keywords in the "title", "sample type", or "source_name" fields. 3. Upon reviewing the data, I don't see any indication that this sample is a cell line. The "sample type" is listed as "normal", and the "source_name" is "stomach", which suggests it's a tissue sample from a human donor.  Conclusion: Since there is no evidence to suggest that this sample is a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN17615474	ATAC-Seq	{"active ingredient":"Emtricitabine, Tenofovir_DF", "age":"42", "art start year":"2016", "average tagmented library size":"992", "bal sampling date":"2019/10/31", "cd4 count":"208", "cigarette smoker":"no", "ethnicity":"Asian", "fragments in clean bam":"38937371", "lane":"1,2", "mtb challenged":"yes", "prescription drugs":"Truvada", "quantiferon tb reagent":"no", "recreational drugs":"no", "sequencing run":"6", "sex":"male", "sexually transmitted infections":"Chlamydia â€“ 2017", "source_name":"bronchoalveolar lavage", "title":"ATAC-Seq Pre-exposure prophylaxis sample 34, Alveolar macrophage, Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenged library"}	Let's go through the data step by step to determine if it's a cell line and extract the cell line name if possible.  1. Check for keywords related to cell lines: I don't see any obvious keywords like "cell line", "culture", or specific cell line names. 2. Look for metadata that might indicate a cell line:  * "organism" is set to "Homo sapiens", which could be either a human sample or a cell line.  * "source_name" is set to "bronchoalveolar lavage", which suggests a biological sample rather than a cell line. 3. Check for any other clues that might indicate a cell line:  * The presence of "sequencing run", "lane", and "fragments in clean bam" suggests a sequencing experiment, but doesn't necessarily imply a cell line.  After reviewing the data, I couldn't find any strong evidence to suggest that this sample is a cell line. Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's a cell line:  * The "cell type" field has a value of "Epithelial", which could be related to a cell line.  * The "title" field contains the string "U2OS", which is actually the name of a well-known osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS). 4. Given this information, I'm going to take an educated guess that the sample is indeed from the U2OS cell line.  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "U2OS"}  Please let me know if I'm correct or not!	U2OS	CVCL:0042	U2OS		CVCL:0042	CVCL:0042	U2OS	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"C4-2B"`. 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the `"cell line"` key. 5. The extracted cell line name is `"C4-2B"`. 6. I format my output as JSON, with the extracted cell line name as the value for the key `"cell_line"`.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "C4-2B"}`	C4-2B	CVCL:4784	LNCaP C4-2B		CVCL:4784	CVCL:4784	LNCaP C4-2B	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "organism" or "source_name". 3. In this case, the "organism" field has a value of "Homo sapiens", which doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. 4. The "source_name" field has a value of "PBMC", which stands for Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells. This suggests that the sample is not a cell line, but rather primary cells isolated from blood.  Since I couldn't find any indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN20109697	ChIP-Seq	{"cell line":"C4-2", "cell type":"prostate cancer cell line", "chip antibody":"anti-MYC (Cell Signaling)", "medium condition":"In RPMI 1640 medium with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS (CSS)", "source_name":"C4-2 cell", "title":"MYC-C4-2-DHT_rep1", "treatment":"10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 4 hours"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "C4-2". 4. Since the key "cell line" is present and has a non-empty value, I conclude that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is "C4-2".

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. In this case, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"human MPNST tumor-derived cell line"`. This phrase contains the words "cell line", which indicates that it might be a cell line. 3. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the phrase "human MPNST tumor-derived cell line" doesn't seem to contain a specific cell line name like HeLa or Jurkat. 4. Since I couldn't find a clear cell line name in the input data, my output will be: `{"cell_line": "None"}`  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see that the "source_name" field mentions "neural crest stem cells", which could be a type of cell culture, but it's not a specific cell line name. 4. Since I couldn't find any explicit mention of a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON data and parse it to extract the relevant information. 2. I look for a key that indicates the sample is a cell line. In this case, I find two potential keys: "cell line" and "source_name". 3. The value associated with the "cell line" key is "differentiated HepaRG cells day 30". This suggests that the sample is indeed a cell line. 4. However, the value is not just a simple name, but rather a descriptive phrase. I need to decide whether to extract this entire phrase or try to find a more concise cell line name. 5. Upon closer inspection, I notice that the "source_name" key has a value of "HepaRG cell line". This suggests that "HepaRG" might be the actual cell line name. 6. Given the context and the fact that "HepaRG" is a well-known cell line, I decide to extract this as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "HepaRG"} ```	HepaRG	CVCL:9720	HepaRG		CVCL:9720		None	FALSE	missed non-cell line	Deriviation

I check if the input data is for a cell line by looking at the "source_name" field, which says "Cell line". This suggests that it might be a cell line.  3. I look for a specific field that contains the cell line name. In this case, I find the field "cell line" with value "SU-CCS-1 (RRID:CVCL_B470)".  4. Since I found a cell line name, I extract it and create the output JSON data: {"cell_line": "SU-CCS-1"}  Note that I ignored the "(RRID:CVCL_B470)" part, as it seems to be an additional identifier rather than part of the cell line name.  So, my final answer is:  {"cell_line": "SU-CCS-1"}	SU-CCS-1	CVCL:B470	SU-CCS-1		CVCL:B470	CVCL:B470	SU-CCS-1	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for keywords like "cell line" or "source_name" equal to "Cell line". In this case, both conditions are met.  3. Since it's a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the input data. The key "cell line" has the value "DTC1 (CVCL_0J31)". However, according to your instructions, I should only extract the string that represents the cell line name, without any additional information.  4. Therefore, I will extract only "DTC1" as the cell line name.  5. My output will be in JSON format: {"cell_line": "DTC1"}  Is this correct?

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. In this case, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines"`, which indicates that it's indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for a specific cell line name within the input data. I'll check the values of all keys to see if any of them match known cell line names or patterns. 4. Ah-ha! I found a potential match in the value of the key `"source_name"`, which is `"SPT5-dTAG DLD1"`. The part that looks like a cell line name is `"DLD1"`. 5. After verifying that `"DLD1"` is indeed a known cell line name, I'll extract it as the cell line name.  So, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "DLD1"}`  Let me know if this looks correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type". 3. The value of "cell type" is "Adipose-Derived Stem Cells". While this suggests a specific type of cell, it doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. I won't find any other field that seems to contain a cell line name.  Since I couldn't find any evidence of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

SAMN20835385	ATAC-Seq	{"source_name":"normal pituitary tissues", "tissue":"normal pituitary tissues", "title":"ATAC-seq_N2"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I can also look for specific values that might indicate a cell line. In this case, I don't see any well-known cell line names like HeLa, Jurkat, or HEK293. 4.

I'll extract the part that seems like a cell line name from the `"source_name"` value: `"GM23716"`. 5. Since I was able to find a potential cell line name, my output will be in JSON format with the extracted name.  Here's my response: ``` {"cell_line": "GM23716"} ```	GM23716	CVCL:T803	GM23716		CVCL:T803	CVCL:T803	GM23716	TRUE	correct cell line	
SAMN20990758	ATAC-Seq	{"developmental stage":"Day 1 mesendoderm", "source_name":"Induced pluripotent stem cells", "title":"DE DAY1 - ATAC Rep1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see that the "source_name" field mentions "Induced pluripotent stem cells", which could be related to a cell line. 4. But since it's not an explicit cell line name, I won't extract any text from this field.  Given these steps, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the `source_name` field mentions "Prostate cancer cell line", which indicates that this sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for a specific cell line name within the text. In this case, I find "LNCaP" mentioned in the `source_name` field, which is a well-known prostate cancer cell line.  So, based on this analysis, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "LNCaP"}  Let me know if this looks correct!	LNCaP	CVCL:0395	LNCaP		CVCL:0395	CVCL:RW50	MR42D	FALSE	wrong cell line	Wrong extraction

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name in the standard format (e.g., "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc.). 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate a cell line:  * The value for "cell type" contains the phrase "glioma-initiating stem-like cells", which could be related to a specific cell line.  * The value for "source_name" also contains a similar phrase, which might suggest a cell line. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find an explicit cell line name in the standard format. 5. Therefore, according to the rules, my output should indicate that no cell line name was found.  Here's the output:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

The input data is in JSON format, which I can parse. 2. I need to check if the sample is a cell line. To do this, I'll look for keywords like "cell line", "cell culture", or specific cell line names. 3. In this case, I found a field called "cell line" with a value that contains multiple cell line names: "H9 (primed, and naive hPSCs) and Sigma (primed hPSCs, naive hPSCs, day 30 ASECRiAV conversion (trophobast stem cells and extraembryonic mesoderm cells)". 4. Since the sample is a cell line, I need to extract the cell line name(s). In this case, there are two cell lines mentioned: "H9" and "Sigma". 5. However, the instructions ask me to output only one cell line name in JSON format. To handle this, I'll choose the first cell line name mentioned, which is "H9".  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "H9"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see that the "source_name" and "tissue" fields both contain the value "Embryonic stem cell". This could potentially indicate that the sample is an embryonic stem cell line, but it's not a specific cell line name like HeLa or HEK293. 4. Since I couldn't find any explicit mention of a cell line name, my output will be {"cell_line": "None"}.  Here is the output:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate it's not a traditional cell line:  * The "source_name" and "tissue" fields contain text that mentions "ES derived cardiac progenitor cells", which suggests a more specific type of cellular sample rather than a established cell line. 4. Given the lack of explicit cell line information, I will output: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN24320442	ATAC-Seq	{"Stage":"mesoderm", "source_name":"hPSC-derived mesoderm cells", "title":"mesoderm R1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_type", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the "source_name" field contains the string "hPSC-derived mesoderm cells". While this suggests that the sample is derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), it doesn't explicitly indicate a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the value for the key "cell type" is "hASCs". While this suggests a specific type of cell, it's not necessarily a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with value "AC7". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "AC7".  So, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "AC7"}  Let me know if this is correct!	AC7						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I notice that the value of "source_name" is "Cell Line", which suggests that the sample might be a cell line. 3. I look for a specific key in the JSON object that typically contains the name of the cell line. In this case, I find the key "cell line" (note the space) with the value "H1975". 4. Since I found a key that indicates the presence of a cell line and it has a non-empty value, I extract the value as the cell line name. 5. I construct the output JSON object with the extracted cell line name: {"cell_line": "H1975"}.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "H1975"} ```	H1975	CVCL:1511	NCI-H1975		CVCL:1511	CVCL:1511	NCI-H1975	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"source_name"` is `"human lymphoblastoid cell line"`. This phrase suggests that the sample might be a cell line. 3. However, I need to extract a specific cell line name from the input data. Let me take another look... 4. Ah-ha! The value of the key `"title"` is `"Case3_LCL_H33"`, and the "LCL" part seems suspiciously like an abbreviation for a cell line. 5. After some knowledge-based reasoning, I realize that "LCL" stands for Lymphoblastoid Cell Line, which is a type of cell line.  Given these observations, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "None"}`  Wait, what? Why "None"? Well, despite finding hints that the sample might be a cell line, I couldn't extract a specific, well-known cell line name (like HeLa or Jurkat) from the input data. The closest match was an abbreviation ("LCL") that's not a specific cell line name.  If you'd like me to reconsider or provide more context, please let me know!

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name. However, I see some hints in the "cell type" field, which mentions "ESC H9 derived fibroblasts H9F". This could be related to a cell line, but it's not a clear indication. 3. Since I couldn't find any strong evidence of a cell line name, my next step is to check if there are any other fields that might contain this information. After reviewing the data again, I don't see any other relevant fields. 4. Given that I couldn't extract a cell line name from the input data, my output will be {"cell_line": "None"}.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., no "cell_line" key or value), I'll look for other clues. 3. The values in the JSON object seem to describe a human biological sample, with attributes like age, sex, and organism. 4. There is no mention of a specific cell line name, such as HeLa, Jurkat, or HEK293.  Based on these observations, my conclusion is that this sample data does not represent a cell line.

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a cell line:  * The "common name" field says "human", which suggests it's a primary sample from a human donor.  * The "source_name" field mentions "primary NK cells", which implies it's a primary cell sample rather than an immortalized cell line. 4. Given the lack of explicit information about a cell line, I'll conclude that this sample is not a cell line.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "source_name" field contains the string "cell line", which is a strong indication that this sample is indeed a cell line. 3. Next, I'll look for the actual name of the cell line within the "source_name" field. In this case, the full string is "OCI-AML3 NPM1c degron2 cell line". 4. To extract just the cell line name, I can remove the trailing "cell line" from the string. 5.

Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the value for the key "source_name" is "PBMC". While this could be related to a cell line, it's not conclusive on its own. 4. Considering the other values in the JSON object, such as "organism", "disease state", and "cell type", it seems more likely that this sample is from a primary biological source (e.g., blood) rather than a cultured cell line.  Given these observations, I'll conclude that there's no clear indication of a cell line name in the input data. Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might contain this information. 3. The fields "common name", "organism", and "source_name" seem to provide some context, but they don't directly indicate a cell line. 4. However, the field "title" contains the string "ES-derived progenitors". While this doesn't explicitly mention a cell line, it does suggest that the sample might be derived from a specific cell population. 5. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any direct evidence of a cell line name in the provided metadata.  Given these steps, my output would be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if this is correct or if I should have extracted something else!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines, words like "immortalized", etc.). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious indication that this sample is a cell line. The fields like "common name", "organism", and "tissue" suggest it's a biological sample from a specific organism and tissue type. 4.

This looks like it could be a cell line name. 3. However, to confirm, I'll also check if there are any other fields that might indicate it's not a cell line (e.g., "cell type" is "non-hodgkin's lymphoma", which could be a tissue or disease type rather than a cell line). 4. Since the "source_name" field seems to contain a specific, unique name, and there are no other obvious indicators that it's not a cell line, I'll extract the string "Karpas-422 CXCdel" as the potential cell line name.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"ALL"`, which could indicate a cell line, but it's not conclusive on its own. 3. However, the value of the key `"source_name"` is `"SUPB15 (ALL cell line)"`. This suggests that the sample is indeed a cell line, and the name of the cell line is likely "SUPB15". 4. Since I was able to find a cell line name in the input data, my output will be a JSON object with the key `"cell_line"` and the value set to the extracted cell line name.  Here's my output:  `{"cell_line": "SUPB15"}`	SUPB15	CVCL:0103	SUP-B15		CVCL:0103	CVCL:0103	SUP-B15	TRUE	correct cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that this might not be a primary cell culture or tissue sample:     * The "cell type" field has a specific value ("small airway epithelial cells"), which could indicate a cultured cell population.    * The "source_name" field contains the phrase "Sm2 small airway epithelial cells", which sounds like it might be a cell line, but I'm not sure.  Given these observations, I'll err on the side of caution and assume that this is not a well-known cell line. Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Please let me know if I should have extracted something from this data!							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious indication that this sample is a cell line. The fields like "organism", "tissue", and "cell type" suggest it's a primary biological sample rather than a cultured cell line. 4. Given that I couldn't find any evidence of a cell line name in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line.    - Yes, it does! The key "cell line" is present in the JSON object.  3. Since the key "cell line" is present, I extract its value as the cell line name.    - The value of "cell line" is "PANC1".  4.

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain the cell line name: "cell line" and "source_name". 4. The field "cell line" has a value of "SHSY5Y", which seems like a strong candidate for the cell line name. 5. Since I found a potential cell line name, I will extract it and create the output JSON.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for keywords that are commonly associated with cell lines, such as "HeLa", "Jurkat", etc. 3. After scanning the input data, I don't see any of these keywords. The fields and values seem to describe a specific type of B cell from a human donor. 4. Given that there is no indication of a cell line in the input data, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is this correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell line"` with a value of `"WM1205"`. 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the `"cell line"` key. 5. The extracted cell line name is `"WM1205"`. 6. I format my output as JSON, with the extracted cell line name as the value for the key `"cell_line"`.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indicators of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell_line_name", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "cell type" and "source_name" are quite specific and descriptive. This could potentially indicate a primary cell culture rather than a cell line. 4. Since I couldn't find any explicit mention of a cell line, I'll conclude that this sample is not a cell line.  According to the instructions, when no cell line name can be found, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here's my response:   {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. I notice that the value of the key `"cell type"` is `"renal cell carcinoma cell line"`, which indicates that it might be a cell line. 3. However, I also see that the value of the key `"source_name"` is `"RCC4+VA (empty vector) renal cell carcinoma cell line"`, which seems to contain more specific information about the cell line. 4. Since `"RCC4+VA"` appears to be a specific name or identifier for the cell line, I'll extract this as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "RCC4+VA"} ```	RCC4+VA	CVCL:0498	RCC4		CVCL:0498	CVCL:0498	RCC4	TRUE	correct cell line

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking for a field that indicates it's a cell line. In this case, I see the field "cell line/type" which suggests that it might be a cell line.  3. Since "cell line/type" contains the value "RPE", which is a known cell line (Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells), I conclude that the sample is indeed a cell line.  4. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data, which is "RPE".  5. Finally, I output the result in JSON format: {"cell_line": "RPE"}  So, my response would be:  {"cell_line": "RPE"}	RPE						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I receive the JSON data and parse it to extract the relevant information. 2. I look for a key that indicates the sample is a cell line. In this case, I find two potential keys: `"cell line"` and `"source_name"`. 3. Both keys contain the string "U87T cell line", which suggests that this is indeed a cell line sample. 4. Since I found a match, I will extract the cell line name from one of these keys (I'll choose `"cell line"`). 5. The extracted cell line name is "U87T cell line".  Now, I will format my output as JSON:  `{"cell_line": "U87T cell line"}`  Is this correct?	U87T cell line						None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there's no obvious field like "cell_line" or "cell culture", I'll look for keywords commonly associated with cell lines, such as " immortalized", "transformed", or specific cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any of these keywords. 4. The fields present in the data, such as "organism", "tissue", and "source_name", suggest that this sample is from a human tissue rather than a cell line.  Conclusion: Since I couldn't find any indication that this sample is a cell line, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "skeltal muscle stem cells".  3. Since I found a "cell line" key, I will extract its value as the cell line name.  4. The extracted cell line name is "skeltal muscle stem cells".   5.

Check for keywords: I'll look for keywords like "cell line", " immortalized", "transformed", or specific cell line names. 2. Check the organism: If the organism is not Homo sapiens, it could be a cell line from another species. 3. Check the tissue and isolate fields: These might give hints about the sample being a cell line.  After reviewing the data:  * There are no keywords indicating a cell line. * The organism is Homo sapiens, which doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. * The tissue field says "blood", which could be either primary cells or a cell line. However, the isolate field describes a process that sounds like it's working with primary cells.  Based on this analysis, I couldn't find any evidence that suggests this sample is a cell line.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "cell type" and "tissue" are not typical of immortalized cell lines. 4. The presence of "organism" with value "Homo sapiens" suggests it's a human sample, but it doesn't necessarily imply a cell line. 5. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line	
SAMN30002429	ATAC-Seq	{"cell type":"Medulloblastoma", "source_name":"Medulloblastoma", "title":"Icb1487"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious matches to known cell line names. 4. However, I notice that the "title" field contains a string "Icb1487", which could potentially be a cell line name. 5. But without more context or information, it's difficult to confirm whether "Icb1487" is indeed a cell line name.  Given these steps and considerations, my output would be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  This indicates that I couldn't confidently extract a cell line name from the input data.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some hints that might indicate a cell line:  * The "common name" field says "human", which could imply a human-derived cell line.  * The "source_name" field mentions "12Z endometriotic epithelial cells", which sounds like a specific type of cell culture. 4. Despite these hints, I couldn't find any clear indication that this sample is a well-known cell line with a specific name (e.g., HeLa). 5.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the value of the key `"source_name"` is `"CCMCL1 MCL cells"`. This looks promising! 3. I'll extract the string `"CCMCL1 MCL cells"` and check if it matches any known cell line names. 4. After checking, I found that "CCMCL1" doesn't seem to be a widely recognized cell line name, but it's possible that it's a custom or less common cell line. 5. However, since I couldn't find any strong evidence that this is a well-known cell line, I'll err on the side of caution and output `"None"`.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords that are often associated with cell lines (e.g., names of well-known cell lines). 3. Upon reviewing the input data, I don't see any obvious matches to known cell line names. 4. However, I notice that the "title" field contains a value "ID216-Blast". While this doesn't seem like a traditional cell line name, it's possible that it could be a custom or proprietary cell line designation. 5. Given the lack of clear evidence pointing to a well-known cell line, I'll err on the side of caution and assume that this sample is not a standard cell line.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "None"} ```							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is no explicit mention of a cell line name (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 3. However, I do see some specific details about the sample, such as "CD34+ AML cells", which could be a hint about the sample's origin. 4. Since I couldn't find any direct reference to a well-known cell line name, I'll conclude that this sample is not explicitly identified as a cell line.  According to the instructions, when no cell line name can be found, my output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  So, here's my response:   {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

In this case, I notice that there are two fields that could potentially contain the cell line name: "cell line" and "source_name". 4. The field "cell line" has a value of "H460 cells", which seems like a plausible cell line name. 5. Since I found a potential cell line name in the "cell line" field, I will extract it as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "H460"} ```  Note that I removed the word "cells" from the original value, assuming that the actual cell line name is just "H460". If you want me to keep the entire original value, I can do so instead. Let me know!	H460	CVCL:0459	NCI-H460		CVCL:0459	CVCL:0459	NCI-H460	TRUE	correct cell line

I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "LHCN-M2 (PMID: 17559502)". 4. Since the key explicitly mentions "cell line", I can infer that the sample is indeed a cell line. 5. The value associated with the "cell line" key contains the name of the cell line, which is "LHCN-M2". 6. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Looking at the keys in the JSON object, I don't see any obvious indication of a cell line (e.g., "cell_line", "cell culture", etc.). 3. However, I notice that the values for "organism" and "tissue" are quite specific, but they don't seem to point to a well-known cell line. 4. The value for "cell type" is "Resistant (R) cells", which could be a hint, but it's not a clear indication of a cell line. 5.

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for common patterns or keywords in the values of other fields. 3. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that none of the values seem to match common cell line names (e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293). 4. The values appear to describe a biological sample from a specific donor, tissue, and treatment condition.  Given these observations, my conclusion is that this sample does not represent a cell line.

Check if the input data is a cell line:  * The presence of "cell_type" and "organism" fields suggests that this might be a cell line, but we need to confirm. 2. Look for keywords or phrases that indicate a cell line:  * The phrase "primary bone marrow stromal cells" in the "description" field indicates that this is not a immortalized cell line, but rather primary cells. 3. Check if there's an explicit mention of a cell line name:  * There is no explicit mention of a cell line name like HeLa, Jurkat, or HEK293.  Conclusion: Since there's no indication that this sample is a cell line, and no explicit mention of a cell line name, the output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}							None	TRUE	correct non-cell line

I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Since there is no explicit field like "cell_line" or "cell_line_name", I'll look for other fields that might indicate a cell line, such as "cell type". 3. The value of "cell type" is "Gonadal somatic cells". This doesn't seem to be a specific cell line name. 4. I won't find any other field that suggests a cell line name.

I need to check if the input data is a cell line. 2. To do this, I'll look for keywords that indicate a cell line, such as "cell line", "cell type", or specific names of cell lines. 3. In this case, I see that there is a key called "cell line" with value "H9 hESC". 4. Since the input data contains a "cell line" key and its value looks like a specific cell line name, I will extract it as the cell line name.  Output: ``` {"cell_line": "H9 hESC"} ```	H9 hESC	CVCL:1240, CVCL:9773	H9, WA09	Let's compare each term with the input JSON of the sample and calculate a confidence score.  **CVCL_1240.json**  * The name "H9" is similar to the extracted cell line name "H9 hESC", but it doesn't match exactly.

I check if the sample is considered to be a cell line by looking at the value of "cell type". In this case, it's indeed "cell line".  3. Since it's a cell line, I look for the cell line name in the input data. I find two potential candidates: the value of "cell line" (which is "HL-60") and the value of "source_name" (also "HL-60").  4. However, since there is a specific key called "cell line", I will prioritize that one.  5. Therefore, I extract the cell line name from the input data: "HL-60".  6. Finally, I format my output as JSON: {"cell_line": "HL-60"}  So, here's my response:  {"cell_line": "HL-60"}	HL-60	CVCL:0002	HL-60		CVCL:0002	CVCL:0002	HL-60	TRUE	correct cell line
