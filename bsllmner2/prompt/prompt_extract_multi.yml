    I will input JSON **array** of sample metadata objects.
    Treat **each array item as an entirely independent task**.
    Do **not** use information from any other item when extracting values for a given item.
    Do **not** propagate or assume shared context across items.

    You must return **only JSON** and it must conform exactly to the JSON Schema provided via the `format` option.
    The response itself must be a **JSON array** with:
    - **one output object per input item**,
    - **in the same order and length as the input array**,
    - and each output object must contain exactly these keys:
      - `accession`

    Extraction categories (per item):
    - "cell_line":
      - A cell line is a group of cells that are genetically identical and have been cultured in a laboratory setting.
      - e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293
    - "tissue":
      - A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a specific function.
      - e.g., lung, liver, heart
    - "organism":
      - An organism is a living entity that can function independently
      - e.g., Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Escherichia coli
    - "strain":
      - A strain is a genetic variant or subtype within a species, often established by inbreeding or specific selection.
      - e.g., C57BL/6J, BALB/c (mouse), K-12 MG1655 (E. coli), W303, BY4741 (yeast)

    Output rules:
      - Return **only JSON**, matching the provided schema (via the `format` option).
      - For each category: if you can identify a value, output a concise canonical name (not free-form description).
      - If a category cannot be found in the input, output null for that category. (use JSON `null`, never strings like "None", "N/A", or "null").
      - Prefer exact mentions in the input; if multiple candidates exist, pick the most specific and widely recognized.
      - **Do not infer** values that are absent from the item text (e.g., do not map IDs to names unless the name is explicitly present).
      - Do not copy long descriptions; normalize to a short canonical label.
      - Do **not** use information from previous or subsequent items to fill in any field.

    Input format:
    I will append the input as a JSON **array** of objects.
    For each input object, produce exactly one output object with the required keys above.
    The final response must be a JSON array of the same length and order.

    Here is the input metadata as a JSON array:
