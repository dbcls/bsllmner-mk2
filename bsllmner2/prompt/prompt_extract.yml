    A cell line is a group of cells that are genetically identical and have been cultured in a laboratory setting. For example, HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc. are names of commonly used cell lines.

    I will input json formatted metadata of a sample for a biological experiment. If the sample is considered to be a cell line, extract the cell line name from the input data.

    Your output must be JSON format, like {"cell_line": "NAME"} .
    "NAME" is just a place holder. Replace this with a string you extract.

    When input sample data is not of a cell line, you are not supposed to extract any text from input.
    If you can not find a cell line name in input, your output is like {"cell_line": "None"} .
    Are you ready?
