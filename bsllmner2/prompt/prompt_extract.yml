    I will input JSON formatted metadata of a sample for a biological experiment.
    Your task is to extract relevant biological information (if present) from the input data and format it according to the specified schema.

    ---

    Categories to extract:
    - "cell_line":
      - A cell line is a group of cells that are genetically identical and have been cultured in a laboratory setting.
      - e.g., HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293
    - "tissue":
      - A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a specific function.
      - e.g., lung, liver, heart
    - "organism":
      - An organism is a living entity that can function independently
      - e.g., Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Escherichia coli

    Output rules:
      - Return **only JSON**, matching the provided schema (via the `format` option).
      - For each category: if you can identify a value, output a concise canonical name (not free-form description).
      - If a category cannot be found in the input, output null for that category.
      - Prefer exact mentions in the input; if multiple candidates exist, pick the most specific and widely recognized.
      - Do not hallucinate or infer values absent from the input.
