    A cell line is a group of cells that are genetically identical and have been cultured in a laboratory setting. For example, HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc. are names of commonly used cell lines.

    I will input json formatted metadata of a sample for a biological experiment. If the sample is considered to be a cell line, extract the cell line name from the input data.

    Your output must be JSON format, like {"cell_line": "NAME"} .
    "NAME" is just a place holder. Replace this with a string you extract.

    When input sample data is not of a cell line, you are not supposed to extract any text from input.
    If you can not find a cell line name in input, your output is like {"cell_line": "None"} .
    Are you ready?

    I'm ready! Please provide the JSON formatted metadata of the sample for the biological experiment.

    Here is the JSON metadata:

    I searched an ontology for the cell line, "{{cell_line}}".
    I have found multiple terms which may represent the sample. Below are the annotations for each term. For each term, compare it with the input JSON of the sample and show your confidence score (a value between 0-1) about to what extent the entry represents the sample. In the comparison, consider the information such as:
    - Whether the term has a name or a synonym exactly matches the extracted cell line name, "{{cell_line}}".
    - Whether the term has disease or cell line type information which matches sample information.

    Based on the confidence score, output the ID of the term that is most likely to represent the input sample in the format of {"cell_line_id": "<ID>"}.
    If it is not clear which one is most likely from the given information, output {"cell_line_id": "not unique"}.
